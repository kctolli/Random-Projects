## Requirements

*Write a simple software simulation of the following system.*

*	The system should simulate the heat transfer from a solar panel to a storage tank
*	Use whichever coding language you wish
*	We will evaluate thermodynamic correctness, code approach, and result

### Heat Conduction

#### Equation

$$
